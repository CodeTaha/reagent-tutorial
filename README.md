# reagent-tutorial

This is a port of the [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om)
[tutorial](https://github.com/swannodette/om/wiki/Tutorial) to
[Reagent](https://github.com/holmsand/reagent). The two libraries
are both ClojureScript UI libraries built on top of
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). It interesting to
compare/contrast the two approaches.

## Usage

    git clone <this repo>
    cd reagent-tutorial
    lein cljsbuild auto

Open [`app.html`]() and read/edit [`src-cljs/reagent_tutorial/core.cljs`]().

Feedback welcome!
